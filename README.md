# 1-4-16-Bit-Hybrid-Adder

The objective of this project is to design both 4-bit and 16-bit Ripple Carry Adders (RCAs)
and Conventional Carry Look-Ahead Adders (CLAs), with a primary goal of demonstrating
that the Ripple Carry Adder (RCA) is faster than the Conventional Carry Look-Ahead Adder
(CLA) under certain conditions. The project aims to carry out a comprehensive comparison
between the two adder architectures by evaluating critical parameters such as delay, power
consumption, area, and overall performance. Although the CLA is traditionally known for
its speed due to parallel carry computation, this study will prove that, in certain scenarios, the
RCA can outperform the CLA, particularly when considering smaller bit-widths or specific
process technologies. The design process will involve utilizing UMSC 65nm technology
and Cadence Virtuoso for the creation and simulation of both 4-bit and 16-bit adders. This
work will explore the trade-offs between simplicity and performance, with a focus on the
Ripple Carry Adderâ€™s ability to deliver faster results despite its inherent delay due to carry
propagation. By analyzing the scalability and energy efficiency of both designs, this project
aims to offer valuable insights into the real-world application of digital adders, contributing
to the optimization of high-performance digital systems.
